-- COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE FIX
-- This fixes all RLS policies for organizer and attendee flows
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- =====================================================

-- ============ PART 1: Fix user_profiles and user_roles ============

-- Ensure role column exists
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'attendee';

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop and recreate policies for user_profiles
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Fix user_roles if it exists
DO $$ 
BEGIN
  IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'user_roles') THEN
    ALTER TABLE user_roles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create comprehensive policies for events
-- Public can view published events
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view published events" ON events

-- Create comprehensive policies
-- Users can view their own registrations
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own registrations" ON event_attendees
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Organizers can view attendees for their events
CREATE POLICY "Organizers can view event attendees" ON event_attendees
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM events 
      WHERE events.id = event_attendees.event_id
