```

### State Management
- **App State**: Extended to handle blog, events, and booking flows
- **Navigation**: Updated with blog and events navigation
- **Authentication**: Integrated throughout booking process

### Data Flow

#### Blog Flow:
1. User clicks "BLOG" in navigation
2. BlogContainer loads with BlogList view
3. BlogList fetches articles via BlogService
4. User can search, filter, and load more articles
5. Clicking article navigates to BlogArticle view
6. Related articles shown at bottom

#### Booking Flow:
1. User views events in EventsSection
2. Authentication check before booking
3. CalendarSelection for date/time picking
4. Integration with existing PaymentPage
5. Success confirmation via PaymentSuccess

## User Experience Features

### Loading States
- Skeleton loading for articles and events
- Smooth transitions between states
- Progress indicators for async operations

### Error Handling
- Network error recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive layouts for all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interactions

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

## Integration Points

### Existing Components
- **Navigation**: Extended with blog and events links
- **PaymentPage**: Reused for booking payments
- **PaymentSuccess**: Reused for booking confirmation
- **AuthModal**: Integrated for login requirements

### Database Schema
The existing database schema supports the booking system through the events table. For a production implementation, consider adding:

```sql
-- Additional tables for production use
CREATE TABLE blog_articles (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title text NOT NULL,
  slug text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  excerpt text,
  content text,
  author text,
  published_date date,
  category text,
  featured boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE event_bookings (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES app_users(id),
  event_id text NOT NULL,
  selected_date date,
  selected_time text,
  booking_status text DEFAULT 'confirmed',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

## Testing Instructions

### Blog Section Testing
1. Navigate to blog section via navigation
2. Test search functionality with various terms
3. Filter by different categories
4. Click "Load More" to test pagination
5. Click on articles to view full content
6. Test related articles navigation
7. Verify responsive behavior on mobile

### Event Booking Testing
1. Navigate to events section
2. Test without authentication (should prompt login)
3. Login and test booking flow
4. Select different dates and time slots
5. Complete booking through payment
6. Verify booking confirmation
7. Test with sold-out events

### Error Scenarios
1. Test with network disconnection
2. Test invalid search queries
3. Test booking without date selection
4. Test payment failures

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Memoization**: Expensive calculations cached
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with proper sizing
- **Bundle Splitting**: Separate chunks for blog and booking features

### Monitoring
- Loading time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- User interaction analytics
- Performance metrics collection

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT token validation
- Session timeout handling
- Secure route protection
- User permission checks

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- SQL injection prevention

## Future Enhancements

### Blog Features
- Comment system
- Social sharing
- Newsletter subscription
- Author profiles
- Content management system

### Booking Features
- Recurring events
- Group bookings
- Waitlist functionality
- Booking modifications
- Email notifications

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in production:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### Build Optimization
- Enable code splitting
- Optimize images
- Minify CSS/JS
- Enable gzip compression

This implementation provides a solid foundation for both blog management and event booking functionality while maintaining clean code architecture and excellent user experience.
